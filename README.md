## Overview
### IDS-NLP-disaster-tweets
### Project for LTAT.02.002 Introduction to Data Science course. Creating a NLP machine to predict whether tweets are about natural disasters or not.
#### Team: Robyn Tomson and Otto-Cristofer Vanasaun


Competition link: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/nlp-getting-started/data

#### Goal 1: 
Get an understanding of how an ML algorithm “understands” and processes language (words, context, metaphorical meanings)

#### Goal 2: 
Train a machine-learning algorithm for the competition and configure it to get as good of a score as possible.

#### Goal 3: 
Understand the basics of language models well enough to explain it to an average person (to be able to alleviate the panic when an LLM responds to prompts with coherent sentences).
