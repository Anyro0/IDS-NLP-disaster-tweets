Goal 1: Get an understanding of how an ML algorithm “understands” and processes language (words, context, metaphorical meanings)

Goal 2: Train a machine-learning algorithm for the competition and configure it to get as good of a score as possible.

Goal 3: Understand the basics of language models well enough to explain it to an average person (to be able to alleviate the panic when an LLM responds to prompts with coherent sentences).
