# IDS-NLP-disaster-tweets
Project for LTAT.02.002 Introduction to Data Science course. NLP machine learning to predicts whether tweets are about natural disasters or not.

Goal 1: Get an understanding of how an ML algorithm “understands” and processes language (words, context, metaphorical meanings)

Goal 2: Train a machine-learning algorithm for the competition and configure it to get as good of a score as possible.

Goal 3: Understand the basics of language models well enough to explain it to an average person (to be able to alleviate the panic when an LLM responds to prompts with coherent sentences).


Team: Robyn Tomson and Otto-Cristofer Vanasaun


## Integrating  git into jupyter notebook

1. Install the JupyterLab Git extension
   ```bash
   pip install jupyterlab-git
    ```

2. Enable the extension
   ```bash
   jupyter lab build
    ```

3. Start JupyterLab (integrated git dosn't work with jupyter notebook)
   ```bas
   jupyter lab
    ```
